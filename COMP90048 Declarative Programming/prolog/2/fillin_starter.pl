% solve_puzzle(Puzzle0, WordList, Puzzle)
% should hold when Puzzle is a solved version of Puzzle0, with the
% empty slots filled in with words from WordList.  Puzzle0 and Puzzle
% should be lists of lists of characters (single-character atoms), one
% list per puzzle row.  WordList is also a list of lists of
% characters, one list per word.
%
% This code is obviously wrong: it just gives back the unfilled puzzle
% as result.  You'll need to replace this with a working
% implementation.
